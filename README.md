# ReDerb

***Unfinished WIP! DO NOT USE***  
[Derb](https://github.com/jasonbraganza/derb) is Python. ReDerb is Go.

## What is ReDerb
ReDerb takes a path, containing a folder full of audio files and creates a podcast feed … 
- with the settings you provide in ReDerb’s settings file
- with only a single directory. ReDerb does not recurse into subdirectories

## Why ReDerb
I want to learn Go.  
So rewriting something I use frequently is good motivation

## Tasks as I see them
- now in the [work log](work-log.md)
