# ReDerb

***Unfinished WIP! DO NOT USE***  
[Derb](https://github.com/jasonbraganza/derb) is Python. ReDerb is Go.

## What is ReDerb
ReDerb takes a path, containing a folder full of audio files and creates a podcast feed … 
## Requirements
- A folder full of audio files that have audio tags in them.  
 (if not, use something like Ex Falso, Puddletag, and Kid3 on Linux or Tag & Rename on Windows (paid software, I’m not aware of opensource options on Windows) to tag them the way you want.)

### With the following constraints …
- with the settings you provide in ReDerb’s settings file
- with only a single directory. ReDerb does not recurse into subdirectories

## Why ReDerb
I want to learn Go.  
So rewriting something I use frequently is good motivation
